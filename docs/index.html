        <h2>By using this site, you agree to the following:</h2>
        <p>
          1. Respectful Use -- Please speak kindly and respectfully, just as you would in church.<br>
          Do not use offensive, hateful, or inappropriate language.<br>
          Do not try to trick or confuse the chatbot into saying things it shouldn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Not a Priest or Counselor -- Ask Daily Faith is not a priest, counselor, or doctor.<br>
          It cannot hear your confession or give official Church guidance.<br>
          For serious spiritual, personal, or medical concerns, always talk to a real priest, adult, or professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Faithful to Catholic Teaching -- The chatbot follows Catholic teaching based on the Bible, Catechism, and tradition.<br>
          It won't discuss political topics or anything that goes against Church values.<br>
          If you ask something outside its boundaries, it may gently refuse or suggest another way to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Privacy & Sessions -- Your session is stored temporarily to help the chatbot remember what you've said.<br>
          It does not ask for your name, email, or personal information.<br>
          If needed, messages may be saved to help improve the experience or prevent misuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. About the Creator -- This chatbot was made by William Cain, a 15-year-old Catholic student and coder.<br>
          Built using OpenAI and tools like VSCode, GitHub, and Render.<br>
          Created with the hope of helping others grow in faith.
        </p>
